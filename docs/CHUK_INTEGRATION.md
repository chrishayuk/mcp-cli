# Chuk Library Integration for MCP-CLI Simplification

## Overview

This document outlines how MCP-CLI can be simplified by leveraging the Chuk library ecosystem:
- **chuk-llm** (v0.12.2) - LLM conversation management, streaming, and tool handling
- **chuk-tool-processor** - MCP server connection and tool execution
- **chuk-term** - Terminal UI and output management

## Key Simplifications Achieved

### 1. Conversation Management
**Before**: 440 lines in `chat_context.py`
**After**: ~200 lines in `chat_context_v2.py`

```python
# Before: Manual conversation tracking
self.conversation_history = []
self.conversation_history.append({"role": "user", "content": msg})

# After: Automatic with chuk-llm
async with conversation("ollama", "gpt-oss") as conv:
    response = await conv.ask(msg)
```

### 2. Streaming Response Handling
**Before**: 774 lines in `streaming_handler.py`
**After**: Simple async iteration

```python
# Before: Complex StreamingResponseHandler
# Manual chunk parsing, tool extraction, buffer management

# After: Native chuk-llm streaming
async for chunk in conv.stream(prompt, tools=tools):
    if "response" in chunk:
        print(chunk["response"])
    if "tool_calls" in chunk:
        execute_tools(chunk["tool_calls"])
```

### 3. Tool Execution
**Before**: Complex tool name sanitization and extraction
**After**: Direct integration with chuk-tool-processor

```python
# Using chuk-tool-processor for MCP servers
tool_processor = ToolProcessor()
await tool_processor.add_server("sqlite", server_config)
tools = await tool_processor.get_tools_for_llm()

# Execute tools from chuk-llm responses
if "tool_calls" in result:
    for tc in result["tool_calls"]:
        result = await tool_processor.execute_tool(
            tc["function"]["name"],
            json.loads(tc["function"]["arguments"])
        )
```

### 4. Cancellation Support
**Before**: Complex interrupt handling
**After**: Clean async cancellation

```python
# Proper cancellation with chuk-llm
with suppress(asyncio.CancelledError):
    async for chunk in conv.stream(prompt):
        if cancelled:
            break
        # Process chunk
```

## Example: Complete Chat Loop

```python
# Simplified chat loop using chuk libraries
async def chat_loop():
    # Setup MCP servers
    tool_processor = ToolProcessor()
    await tool_processor.add_server("sqlite", server_config)
    tools = await tool_processor.get_tools_for_llm()
    
    # Conversation with automatic management
    async with conversation("ollama", "gpt-oss") as conv:
        while True:
            user_input = input("ðŸ‘¤: ")
            
            if user_input == "exit":
                break
            
            # Stream response with tool support
            print("ðŸ¤–: ", end="", flush=True)
            tool_calls = []
            
            async for chunk in conv.stream(user_input, tools=tools):
                if "response" in chunk:
                    print(chunk["response"], end="", flush=True)
                if "tool_calls" in chunk:
                    tool_calls.extend(chunk["tool_calls"])
            
            # Execute any tools
            for tc in tool_calls:
                result = await tool_processor.execute_tool(
                    tc["function"]["name"],
                    json.loads(tc["function"]["arguments"])
                )
                print(f"\n   Tool result: {result}")
```

## Conclusion

By leveraging the Chuk library ecosystem, MCP-CLI can:
1. **Remove thousands of lines** of redundant code
2. **Gain advanced features** like session tracking and branching
3. **Improve maintainability** with cleaner architecture
4. **Focus on core value** - MCP server integration and UI
