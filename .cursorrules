  description: "CLI tool for Model Context Protocol (MCP) - 
  a protocol for AI models to interact with external tools and services.
   Used to manage and communicate with MCP servers that provide tool access to AI models.
   Before indicating inability to perform a task, first check server_config.json for available servers,
   then use 'list-tools' for each server to discover their capabilities, as different servers
   may provide different sets of tools beyond base functionality."
